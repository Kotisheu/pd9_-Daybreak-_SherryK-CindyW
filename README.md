=============================

FINAL PROJECT :)
(Uhh.. late, but better late than never?) 

Our project is an rpg, where you start off with a one character and you can move through different areas (towns, battle fields). Several features have been left out (for example we only have half the story we expected), but the meat of the game works (all of the areas are there, and you can move through each area, and the battle system works).

To start the game you need to compile Game.java. You should have no problem figuring out what to do in the game.
